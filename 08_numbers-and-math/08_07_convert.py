# Demonstrate how to:
# -------------------
# 1) Convert an int to a float
# 2) Convert a float to an int - loose the decimal information
# 3) Perform division using a float and an int.
# 4) Use two variables to perform a multiplication.
#
# What information is lost during which conversions?

int_num = 2
float_num = 3.14
print(float(int_num))
print(int(float_num))
print (float_num / int_num)
